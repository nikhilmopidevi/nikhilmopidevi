### Hello, there! My name is Nikhil.

I love to create products which solve problems.
   
## Many of my repositories are from my early years of programming when still in college. The code in them isn't anywhere near to what I write nowadays. I write much better, modular, clean, and efficient code now.

Some blog posts from my programming blog [Semicolon](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/):
- [Overview of the Java Collections Framework](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/2017/06/19/Overview-of-the-Java-Collections-Framework/)
- [Commonly used JavaScript functions](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/2020/04/11/Commonly-used-JavaScript-functions/)
- [Cloning Objects in JavaScript](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/2020/05/10/Cloning-Objects-in-JavaScript/)
- [WebSockets with AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/2017/10/18/WebSockets-with-AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk/)
- [HTTPS for WebSockets App on AWS](https://nikhilmopidevi.github.io/2017/10/22/HTTPS-for-WebSockets-App-on-AWS/)
